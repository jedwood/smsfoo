SMS Foo : SMS-ify your Wufoo forms
---

[WuFoo](http://wufoo.com) is pretty awesome even for those of us that know how to make forms from scratch.

Sometimes filling out quick surveys or sign-up forms is best done via SMS. [Twilio](http://twilio.com) makes that a snap.

_SMS Foo_ lets you build and use the same WuFoo form for both web-based and SMS interactions.

##Setup

See `config-sample.json` for the list of variables you'll need to define either via a `config.json` file or through the environment variables that your host passes to the app.
